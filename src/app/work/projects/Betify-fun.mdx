## Overview

Betify.fun is a startup cryptocurrency-based online casino.
Betify.fun is launching a new games portal for users to explore the site’s gaming options. In the interest of boosting company revenue, they would like the game portal to direct users towards Betify.fun’s highest earning games, and away from ones that favor players to win more frequently.

Additionally, Betify.fun is going Web 3.0 with the launch of its newly issued stablecoin token, funchips! User cryptocurrency is exchanged for funchips in order to play games on Betify.fun, using an innovative dynamic pricing model, and Betify.fun would like to encourage users to invest in more funchips for gaming through bulk pricing incentives & investment opportunities.
I used Figma and After Effect for this project.
